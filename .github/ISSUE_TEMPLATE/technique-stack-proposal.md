# Proposal: Add [Tool Name] for [Purpose]

## What is this?
[Tool Name] is a [brief description, e.g., "tool for monitoring AI apps"] that helps us:
✅ Track [e.g., "LLM responses and errors"]
✅ Test [e.g., "if our AI gives good answers"]
✅ Monitor [e.g., "speed and cost"]

## Why do we need it?
Right now, we have a problem:
❌ [Current issue 1, e.g., "We don't know why the AI sometimes gives wrong answers"]
❌ [Current issue 2, e.g., "Manual testing takes too much time"]

With [Tool Name], we can:
✔ [Benefit 1, e.g., "See every AI call in one dashboard"]
✔ [Benefit 2, e.g., "Automatically check for bad responses"]
