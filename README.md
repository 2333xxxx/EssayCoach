# EssayCoach

EssayCoach is an AI-powered essay coaching platform that provides instant, multi-dimensional feedback to students while offering educators robust analytical tools. Built with Vue 3 frontend and Python Django backend, designed for scalability and educational research.

## Quick Start
**Zero-config development with Nix:**
```bash
nix develop  # Enter dev shell with all tools
pnpm dev     # Start frontend (localhost:5173)
poetry run python manage.py runserver  # Start backend (localhost:8000)
```

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite |
| **UI Framework** | Naive UI + UnoCSS |
| **State Management** | Pinia |
| **Backend** | Python 3.11 + Django |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (dev/prod), SQLite (testing) |
| **Async Processing** | Django async views (MVP) â†’ Redis + Celery |
| **Dev Environment** | Nix flakes + Poetry + pnpm |
| **Testing** | Vitest (frontend) + Pytest (backend)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) (with flakes enabled, recommended for consistent dev environments)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) (if not using Nix)
- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/) (if not using Nix)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (if not using Nix)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/EssayCoach.git
cd EssayCoach
```

### 3. Enter the Nix Development Shell (Recommended)

#### Using Nix Flakes (Preferred)
```sh
nix develop
```
This will provide all necessary tools for both main and backend development using the flake.nix configuration.

---

## Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite)

### Setup
```sh
cd main
pnpm install
```

### Development Server
```sh
cd main
pnpm run dev
```
The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

### Build for Production
```sh
cd main
pnpm run build
```

---

## Backend (Python + FastAPI)

### Setup
```sh
cd backend
poetry install
```

### Development Server
```sh
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by default.

---

## Database
- **PostgreSQL** is the default for development. Ensure it is running and accessible at the URL in your environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`).
- **SQLite** can be used for quick prototyping (see `.gitignore` for ignored files).

---

## Environment Variables
Set these in your shell or in a `.env` file (see `.gitignore` for ignored env files):
- `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `postgresql://localhost:5432/essaycoach_dev`)
- `REDIS_URL` (e.g., `redis://localhost:6379`)
- `NODE_ENV` (e.g., `development`)

---

## Testing
- **Frontend:**
  ```sh
  pnpm run test
  ```
- **Backend:**
  ```sh
  poetry run pytest
  ```

## Branch Naming Rules

When creating branches for this project, please follow these naming conventions:

- Feature:      feature/<issue-id>-<short-description>
- Bugfix:       bugfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>
- Hotfix:       hotfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>
- Release:      release/<version>
- Documentation: docs/<short-description>
- Refactoring:  refactor/<short-description>


### General Guidelines
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words.
- Keep branch names short but descriptive.
- Avoid using special characters or spaces.

---



## Contributing
- Use feature branches and submit pull requests for review.
- Follow code style guidelines (Prettier, ESLint for main; Black, Flake8 for backend).
- Write tests for new features.
- Report bugs or request features using our [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) - choose from Bug Report, User Story, Technical Task, Documentation Update, or Spike/Research templates.

---

## Additional Notes

- Use the Nix shell for a consistent, reproducible environment.
- For Docker-based development, see `docker-compose.yml` (if present).
- For questions, see the `/docs` folder or contact the maintainers.

### Current Front-End Dependencies (managed by `pnpm`)

The `main/package.json` is already pre-populated with the core libraries your Vue 3 SPA needs:

| Category | Package |
|----------|---------|
| Framework | `vue@^3` |
| State | `pinia@^3` |
| Router | `vue-router@^4` |
| Build | `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-vue`, `@vitejs/plugin-vue-jsx` |
| Linting & Format | `eslint`, `eslint-plugin-vue`, `prettier` |
| Testing | `vitest`, `@vue/test-utils`, `cypress` |

You can add more packages at any time with `pnpm add <pkg>`.

### Planned / Upcoming Dependencies

The design documents outline additional services and libraries that are **not yet in the codebase**. These will be integrated iteratively:

- **Frontend:** Axios (API client), a component framework (Element Plus or Vuetify), richer internationalization tooling.
- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Alembic + Pydantic, JWT/OAuth2 libraries, OpenSearch / vector DB client, async workers (e.g. Celery, Redis Queue), LLM/AI SDKs.
- **DevOps / Infra:** Kubernetes toolchain (`kubectl`, `helm`), Alibaba Cloud SDKs, monitoring (Prometheus / OpenTelemetry), CI/CD pipeline scripts.

If you encounter a missing tool while implementing a feature, feel free to update `shell.nix`, `pyproject.toml`, or `package.json` and open a PR.
