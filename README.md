# EssayCoach

EssayCoach is an AI-powered essay coaching platform that provides instant, multi-dimensional feedback to students while offering educators robust analytical tools. Built with Vue 3 frontend and Python Django backend, designed for scalability and educational research.

## Quick Start
**Zero-config development with Nix:**
```bash
nix develop  # Enter dev shell with all tools
# Automatically starts PostgreSQL and sets up environment

# Option 1: Start both servers simultaneously
dev          # Start backend + frontend via Overmind

# Option 2: Start individually
cd backend && python manage.py runserver   # Django backend (localhost:8000)
cd frontend && pnpm dev                    # Vite frontend (localhost:4318)
```
