## Technical Stack

Our technology selection adheres to "API-first," "front-end/back-end separation," and "microservices" principles, ensuring system scalability, maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** **Next.js 15 (React 19)** â€” providing hybrid static/SSR rendering, file-based routing, and strong TypeScript support for building complex applications.
    *   **UI Library:** shadcn/ui built on Radix components and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design system.
    *   **Build Tool:** Next.js (Turbopack) - Offers a fast development server and optimized bundling.

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Main Framework:** **Python (Django)** - Python is the preferred language for AI/ML. Django provides a robust, batteries-included framework with excellent ORM, admin interface, and mature ecosystem. While FastAPI offers high performance for AI services, Django's comprehensive features and stability make it ideal for the core backend architecture. We may consider adding Flask API or Node.js services in the future if we need to handle more concurrent AI API calls.
    *   **Service Architecture:** **Microservices Architecture** - Decomposes core functionalities into independent services (e.g., user service, submission service, AI evaluation service), communicating via an API gateway. This architecture allows independent scaling and updating of each service; for example, upgrading the AI model only requires updating the AI evaluation service.
    *   **MVP Processing:** Django async views + PostgreSQL for lightweight background processing during initial development.
*   **Future Message Queue:** **Redis + Celery** - Used for handling time-consuming asynchronous tasks (like AI evaluation) in production deployment. When a user submits an essay, the request is queued, and backend workers process it asynchronously, preventing API timeouts and significantly improving system responsiveness and throughput.

*   **Database Strategy:**
    Our database strategy involves a two-stage approach for optimal development and scalability:

    *   **Phase 1: Early Stage & Rapid Development (Using SQLite)**
        *   During the initial phase, especially for local development and prototyping, using **SQLite** is an excellent choice. It's a zero-configuration, file-based database that offers simplicity and quick setup, allowing developers to focus on core logic immediately.
        *   **Key Implementation:** It is **crucial** to use an ORM like **SQLAlchemy** from the outset. SQLAlchemy allows our application code to interact with abstract Python objects rather than direct SQL, making the future transition between SQLite and a production database seamless by simply changing the database connection string.

    *   **Phase 2: Scaling & Production Deployment (Migrating to Cloud Database)**
        *   When multi-user concurrency is required, or when deploying to a server for production use, we will migrate to a robust, scalable cloud-hosted database.
        *   **Relational Database:** **PostgreSQL** - Specifically, **ApsaraDB for RDS (PostgreSQL Edition)** on Alibaba Cloud. This managed service will handle performance, backups, and disaster recovery, allowing us to focus on application development.
        *   **Vector Database:** For the RAG core, we will use a dedicated Vector Database like Pinecone, ChromaDB, or Weaviate. On Alibaba Cloud, **ApsaraDB for OpenSearch (Vector Search Edition)** or **Elasticsearch (with vector search capabilities)** offer managed, high-performance vector search, crucial for efficient semantic similarity retrieval.

*   **Development Environment & Package Management:**
    *   **Nix** - A powerful package manager and build system that provides reproducible development environments across different machines and operating systems. Nix ensures consistent dependency management and eliminates "works on my machine" issues, making it ideal for team collaboration and CI/CD pipelines.

*   **Deployment & Operations (DevOps) - Alibaba Cloud Specifics:**
    Given the website's availability in China, **Alibaba Cloud** will be our primary cloud provider, ensuring compliance, low latency, and optimized performance within the region.

    *   **Static Asset Hosting:** Built static frontend files will be hosted on Alibaba Cloud's **OSS (Object Storage Service)**, combined with **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** for accelerated access across China.
    *   **Compute Services:** For backend services, we can initially deploy on **ECS (Elastic Compute Service)**. For our microservices architecture, **ACK (Container Service for Kubernetes)** is highly recommended for elastic scaling and robust container management.
    *   **API Gateway:** We will utilize Alibaba Cloud's **API Gateway** for unified management, security, and throttling of our backend microservice interfaces.
    *   **File Storage:** **OSS** will be used for storing student-submitted essay files.
    *   **AI Model Deployment:** Leverage **PAI-EAS (Platform AI - Elastic Accelerated Service)** for deploying our AI models, which can automatically scale GPU/CPU resources based on request load. For external Large Language Models (LLMs), we will ensure compliant service nodes within mainland China, potentially leveraging Alibaba Cloud's partnerships with domestic LLM providers.
    *   **Message Queues:** **Redis + Celery** - Redis-based message queue with Celery workers for handling asynchronous AI evaluation tasks, ensuring system decoupling and responsiveness while leveraging existing Redis infrastructure.

## AI Evaluation System

This is the core competency of the platform, broken down into three collaborative modules:

*   **1. Grading Engine:**
    *   **Capability:** This engine uses RAG technology to provide objective, quantifiable evaluations of subjective essays.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  **Indexing:** Teachers upload rubrics, which are broken down into specific criteria (e.g., "Argument Clarity," "Evidence Use," "Structural Logic"), converted into vector embeddings, and stored in the vector database.
        2.  **Retrieval:** Upon essay submission, the essay content is segmented and also converted into vectors. For each rubric criterion, the system retrieves the most relevant content snippets from the essay's vectors.
        3.  **Generation:** A Large Language Model (LLM, e.g., GPT-4) receives an instruction containing the "rubric criterion," "retrieved essay snippets," and grading requirements. The LLM then generates a score and commentary for that specific item.
    *   **Comparative Example:** This model **combines the structured rigor of Turnitin GradeMark with the contextual understanding and nuanced feedback capabilities of advanced AI (e.g., GPT-4)**, avoiding the rigidity of traditional keyword matching and overcoming the potential for purely LLM-based evaluations to deviate from standards.

*   **2. Fact-Check Module:**
    *   **Capability:** Automatically verifies factual information within the essay, fostering academic rigor in students.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  **Claim Extraction:** An AI model scans the text to identify verifiable factual claims (e.g., "event X happened in year Y," "substance Z has property P").
        2.  **Query Generation:** These claims are converted into precise search queries.
        3.  **Authoritative Search:** Search engine APIs (e.g., Bing/Google Search API) are called, prioritizing a pre-configured list of authoritative sources (e.g., academic journals, government websites, reputable encyclopedias).
        4.  **Comparison & Judgment:** The AI compares search results against the original claims, labeling them as "verified," "disputed," or "no supporting source found," along with links to evidence.
    *   **Comparative Example:** Imagine it as an **academic version of Google Fact Check tools embedded directly into the writing environment**, helping students correct factual errors during the drafting phase.

*   **3. Writing Advisor Module:**
    *   **Capability:** Provides refined guidance at the grammar, style, and vocabulary levels.
    *   **Functionality Breakdown:**
        *   **Grammar & Syntax:** Identifies and corrects spelling errors, punctuation issues, subject-verb agreement, tense errors, etc.
        *   **Vocabulary Enhancement:** Highlights overused words and suggests synonyms, recommending more precise and impactful vocabulary.
        *   **Style & Fluency:** Analyzes sentence length variation, passive voice usage frequency, and paragraph transition coherence, providing suggestions for improvement.
    *   **Comparative Example:** It offers the **grammatical precision of Grammarly, augmented with stylistic feedback akin to a human writing tutor**, helping students not just write "correctly," but also write "well."
