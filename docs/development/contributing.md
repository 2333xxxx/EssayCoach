## Development Notes

### Branch Workflow & Review Process

#### Documentation Branch Workflow
1. **All documentation changes** must first be merged to the `docs` branch
2. **Documentation includes**:
   - API documentation updates
   - Architecture diagram changes
   - README updates
   - Any `.md` file modifications
3. **After docs branch review**, changes are then merged from `docs` to `main`

#### Code Review Process
1. **Pull Request Requirements**:
   - Must include at least 1 approving review from code owner
   - All CI checks must pass (tests, linting, type checking)
   - Documentation must be updated for any API changes
   - Breaking changes require migration guide

2. **Review Checklist** for reviewers:
   - [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
   - [ ] Tests are included and passing
   - [ ] Documentation is updated
   - [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
   - [ ] Performance considerations addressed
   - [ ] Accessibility standards met (frontend changes)

3. **Review Timeline**:
   - **Initial review**: Within 24 hours on weekdays
   - **Follow-up reviews**: Within 12 hours after updates
   - **Complex changes**: May require 2+ reviewers

#### Branch Protection Rules
- **main branch**: Requires 2 approving reviews + all CI checks
- **docs branch**: Requires 1 approving review + documentation checks
- **feature branches**: Must be up-to-date with target branch before merge

#### Merge Strategy
- **Squash and merge** for feature branches (clean history)
- **Merge commit** for docs â†’ main merges (preserve history)
- **Rebase** only for personal feature branches (never on shared branches)

#### Release Process
1. Create release branch from `main`
2. Update version numbers and changelog
3. Test in staging environment
4. Create PR from release branch to `main`
5. After approval, merge and tag release
6. Deploy to production
